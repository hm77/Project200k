# Question 1: [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/ "Question")
 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.


# Question 2: [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/ "Question")
         
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
